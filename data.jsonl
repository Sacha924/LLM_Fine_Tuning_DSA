{"prompt": "Write an optimized Python function to solve the following problem: There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.). The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round. For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 Player 1 competes against player 7. Player 2 competes against player 6. Player 4 automatically advances to the next round. After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order). The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round. Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively. Example 1: Input: n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4 Output: [3,4] Explanation: One possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number: First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Second round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 Third round: 2, 3, 4 One possible scenario which leads to the latest round number: First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Second round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Third round: 1, 2, 4 Fourth round: 2, 4 Example 2: Input: n = 5, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 5 Output: [1,1] Explanation: The players numbered 1 and 5 compete in the first round.

{"prompt": "Write an optimized Python function to solve the following problem: A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with n vertices where each vertex is labeled from 1 to n (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is time minutes. Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every change minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green. The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value. For example the second minimum value of [2, 3, 4] is 3, and the second minimum value of [2, 2, 4] is 4. Given n, edges, time, and change, return the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n. Notes: You can go through any vertex any number of times, including 1 and n. You can assume that when the journey starts, all signals have just turned green.

The blue path in the figure on the right is the minimum time path. The time taken is: - Start at 1, time elapsed=0 - 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3 - 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6 Hence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes.

Example 1: Input [\"SORTracker\", \"add\", \"add\", \"get\", \"add\", \"get\", \"add\", \"get\", \"add\", \"get\", \"add\", \"get\", \"get\"] [[], [\"bradford\", 2], [\"branford\", 3], [], [\"alps\", 2], [], [\"orland\", 2], [], [\"orlando\", 3], [], [\"alpine\", 2], [], []] Output [null, null, null, \"branford\", null, \"alps\", null, \"bradford\", null, \"bradford\", null, \"bradford\", \"orland\"] Explanation SORTracker tracker = new SORTracker(); // Initialize the tracker system. tracker.add(\"bradford\", 2); // Add location with name=\"bradford\" and score=2 to the system. tracker.add(\"branford\", 3); // Add location with name=\"branford\" and score=3 to the system. tracker.get(); // The sorted locations, from best to worst, are: branford, bradford. // Note that branford precedes bradford due to its higher score (3 > 2). // This is the 1st time get() is called, so return the best location: \"branford\". tracker.add(\"alps\", 2); // Add location with name=\"alps\" and score=2 to the system. tracker.get(); // Sorted locations: branford, alps, bradford. // Note that alps precedes bradford even though they have the same score (2). // This is because \"alps\" is lexicographically smaller than \"bradford\". // Return the 2nd best location \"alps\", as it is the 2nd time get() is called. tracker.add(\"orland\", 2); // Add location with name=\"orland\" and score=2 to the system. tracker.get(); // Sorted locations: branford, alps, bradford, orland. // Return \"bradford\", as it is the 3rd time get() is called. tracker.add(\"orlando\", 3); // Add location with name=\"orlando\" and score=3 to the system. tracker.get(); // Sorted locations: branford, orlando, alps, bradford, orland. // Return \"bradford\". tracker.add(\"alpine\", 2); // Add location with name=\"alpine\" and score=2 to the system. tracker.get(); // Sorted locations: branford, orlando, alpine, alps, bradford, orland. // Return \"bradford\". tracker.get(); // Sorted locations: branford, orlando, alpine, alps, bradford, orland. // Return \"orland\". Constraints: name consists of lowercase English letters, and is unique among all locations. 1 <= name.length <= 10 1 <= score <= 105 At any time, the number of calls to get does not exceed the number of calls to add. At most 4 * 104 calls in total will be made to add and get.", "completion": null}
{"prompt": "Write an optimized Python function to solve the following problem: Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array fruits where fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti] depicts amounti fruits at the position positioni. fruits is already sorted by positioni in ascending order, and each positioni is unique. You are also given an integer startPos and an integer k. Initially, you are at the position startPos. From any position, you can either walk to the left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk at most k steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position. Return the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest. Example 1: Input: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4 Output: 9 Explanation: The optimal way is to: - Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits - Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits You moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total. Example 2: Input: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4 Output: 14 Explanation: You can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10. The optimal way is to: - Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5 - Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit - Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits - Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits You moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total. Example 3: Input: fruits = [[0,3],[6,4],[8,5]], startPos = 3, k = 2 Output: 0 Explanation: You can move at most k = 2 steps and cannot reach any position with fruits. Constraints: 1 <= fruits.length <= 105 fruits[i].length == 2 0 <= startPos, positioni <= 2 * 105 positioni-1 < positioni for any i > 0 (0-indexed) 1 <= amounti <= 104 0 <= k <= 2 * 105", "completion": null}
{"prompt": "Write an optimized Python function to solve the following problem: You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k. The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1. For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because: arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5) arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2) arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6) arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2) However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]). In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer. Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k. Example 1: Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1 Output: 4 Explanation: For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing. Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations. It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations. It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations. Example 2: Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2 Output: 0 Explanation: This is the same example as the one in the problem description. Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i]. Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations. Example 3: Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5. One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5. The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5]. Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations. Constraints: 1 <= arr.length <= 105 1 <= arr[i], k <= arr.length", "completion": null}
{"prompt": "Write an optimized Python function to solve the following problem: You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right]. Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps: Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C. For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546. Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as ... where denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged. For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567. Finally, represent the product as a string \"...eC\". For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as \"12345...89876e5\". Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right]. Example 1: Input: left = 1, right = 4 Output: \"24e0\" Explanation: The product is 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 24. There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with \"e0\". Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further. Thus, the final representation is \"24e0\". Example 2: Input: left = 2, right = 11 Output: \"399168e2\" Explanation: The product is 39916800. There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with \"e2\". The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further. Hence, the abbreviated product is \"399168e2\". Example 3: Input: left = 371, right = 375 Output: \"7219856259e3\" Explanation: The product is 7219856259000. Constraints: 1 <= left <= right <= 104", "completion": null}
