Each node has a value associated with it, and the root of the tree is node 0. To represent this tree, you are given an integer array nums and a 2D array edges. Each nums[i] represents the ith node's value, and each edges[j] = [uj, vj] represents an edge between nodes uj and vj in the tree. Two values x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1 where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y. An ancestor of a node i is any other node on the shortest path from node i to the root.

Given an integer array stones of length n where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the score difference between Alice and Bob if they both play optimally. Example 1: Input: stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5] Output: 5 Explanation: - Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5]. - Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on the left. stones = [-3]. The difference between their scores is 2 - (-3) = 5. Example 2: Input: stones = [7,-6,5,10,5,-2,-6] Output: 13 Explanation: - Alice removes all stones, adds 7 + (-6) + 5 + 10 + 5 + (-2) + (-6) = 13 to her score, and places a stone of value 13 on the left. stones = [13]. The difference between their scores is 13 - 0 = 13. Example 3: Input: stones = [-10,-12] Output: -22 Explanation: - Alice can only make one move, which is to remove both stones. She adds (-10) + (-12) = -22 to her score and places a stone of value -22 on the left. stones = [-22]. The difference between their scores is (-22) - 0 = -22.

The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at. After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting. For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait. However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks. For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately. Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.

You can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) = 1.5 hours.

The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k. The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1. For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because: arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5) arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2) arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6) arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2) However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]). In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer. Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k. Example 1: Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1 Output: 4 Explanation: For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing. Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations. It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations. It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations. Example 2: Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2 Output: 0 Explanation: This is the same example as the one in the problem description. Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i]. Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations. Example 3: Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5. One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5. The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right]. Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps: Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C. For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546. Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as ... where denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged. For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567. Finally, represent the product as a string \"...eC\". For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as \"12345...89876e5\". Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right]. Example 1: Input: left = 1, right = 4 Output: \"24e0\" Explanation: The product is 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 24. There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with \"e0\". Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further. Thus, the final representation is \"24e0\". Example 2: Input: left = 2, right = 11 Output: \"399168e2\" Explanation: The product is 39916800. There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with \"e2\". The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further. Hence, the abbreviated product is \"399168e2\".

However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.

Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums. Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12].

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules: Alice first shoots numArrows arrows and then Bob shoots numArrows arrows. The points are then calculated as follows: The target has integer scoring sections ranging from 0 to 11 inclusive. For each section of the target with score k (in between 0 to 11), say Alice and Bob have shot ak and bk arrows on that section respectively. If ak >= bk, then Alice takes k points. If ak < bk, then Bob takes k points. However, if ak == bk == 0, then nobody takes k points. For example, if Alice and Bob both shot 2 arrows on the section with score 11, then Alice takes 11 points. On the other hand, if Alice shot 0 arrows on the section with score 11 and Bob shot 2 arrows on that same section, then Bob takes 11 points. You are given the integer numArrows and an integer array aliceArrows of size 12, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. Now, Bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain. Return the array bobArrows which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11.
