# LLM Fine Tuning

## Context
chatGPT is good at solving D&A-type problems, but not the hard ones.

If we take the latest problems that come out, for example, the latest hard problem released on LeetCode as I write these lines:

<img src ="img/1.JPG" alt="Problem Statement"/>

## Attempted Solution
When asked to solve it, the answer given is wrong. Below are the images of the attempted solution:

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between;">
  <img src="img/2.JPG" alt="Solution Attempt 1" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 10px;"/>
  <img src="img/3.JPG" alt="Solution Attempt 2" style="width: 45%;"/>
</div>

## The Idea
The goal is to design a more efficient model for code questions.

## Project Goal
My aim is to create a browser extension, in which you can copy and paste a DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm) type question, and the extension will provide the answer to the question.
